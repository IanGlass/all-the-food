# all-the-food
all-the-food is a recipe searching website that makes use of the edamam recipe searching API to fetch a list of recipes based on some parameters:
* A query string such as 'pasta' or 'chicken';
* A diet parameter, which determines dietary preferences such as low-carb or low-fat;
* A health parameter, which determines dietary restrictions such as peanut-free or vegan.

Once a search is made, the recipes panel will be populated with a paginated list of recipes. A recipe can then be selected for viewing, including:
* An image of the recipe;
* Cooking time;
* Number of servings, which can be changed and updates the ingredients list;
* The ingredients list.

The recipe view also includes a link to the recipe origin for cooking instructions, allows the recipe to be added to a favourites list and allows the recipe ingredients to be added to a shopping list. The shopping list concatenates similar ingredients to make shopping easier and can be printed with the 'print shopping list' button.
